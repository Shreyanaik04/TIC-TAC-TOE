*Set of Rules*

1. *Grid*: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, but larger grids can be used for more advanced versions.

2. *Players*: Two players take turns marking spaces on the grid. One player typically uses "X" and the other "O".

3. *Objective*: The objective is to get three of your symbols (Xs or Os) in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

4. *Turns*: Players take turns, with the "X" player usually going first. Each turn consists of placing one of your symbols in an empty square on the grid.

5. *Winning*: If a player succeeds in placing three of their marks in a row, they win the game. The game ends immediately when a player achieves this, and that player is declared the winner.

6. *Draw*: If all squares on the grid are filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game is a draw.

7. *Strategy*: The key to winning is to watch your opponent's moves and plan ahead to either block their attempts to get three in a row or to create your own winning sequences.

Tic-tac-toe is a simple yet entertaining game that can be played quickly, making it a popular choice for passing the time or teaching basic strategy to children.
